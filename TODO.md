# To Do

## I'd really like to build up (or down) to a GLTF viewer. It would need at a minimum

 - [ ] PBR materials
 - [ ] Shadows
 - [ ] Skinning
 - [ ] Animation

## I'd also like to do an editor. It would need

 - [ ] Picking
 - [ ] Highlighting?
 - [ ] Manipulators (translate, rotate, scale)
 - [ ] Camera Controls
 - [ ] Multiple Views

- [X] Use external refs in build
  - [ ] Figure out how to check for device.fn, encoder.fn, pass.fn
- [X] Fix code gen double output for non-struct


- [X] Get webgpu types in live-editor
- [ ] Get eslint to run correctly
  - [ ] recognize WebGPU types
- [ ] Re-style
  - [ ] `<code>stuff</code>`
  - [ ] type table

- [X] explain opaque/premultiplied canvas
- [X] explain typedarrays
- [ ] make table of valid buffer usage combinations for every situation
- [ ] make table of valid texture usage combinations for every situation
- [X] asking for higher limits
- [ ] asking for the fallback
- [X] asking for compat?
- [X] multisample
  - [ ] can we display it at the seam of a quad?

- [X] resizing for the canvas
  - [X] dpr
  - [X] exact match
- [X] points, lines, triangles
- [ ] 

- [X] convert matrix articles
  - [X] translation
  - [X] rotation
  - [X] scaling
  - [X] matrices
  - [X] orthographic 3d
  - [X] perspective
  - [X] camera

- [X] lights
  - [X] directional light
  - [X] point light
  - [X] spot light

- [X] render targets (this is basic and probably belongs under fundamentals)
- [X] textures
  - [X] mip generation
- [X] loading images
  - [X] cross origin images
- [ ] Camera rendering (showing the camera frustum)
- [ ] planar and perspective projection mapping
- [ ] shadows

- [X] cubemaps
- [X] environment maps
- [ ] 2d array textures
- [ ] terrain renderer
- [X] skyboxes
- [ ] skinning
- [ ] picking via GPU
- [ ] fog

- [ ] sprites
- [ ] text
  - [ ] html
  - [ ] canvas
  - [ ] texture
  - [ ] glyphs

- [ ] ramp textures
  - [ ] remapping (photoshop filters)
  - [ ] gpu particles / animation

- [X] pulling vertices
- [X] instanced drawing
- [X] indexed drawing


- [X] scene graphs
- [X] matrix stack
- [ ] drawimage

- [ ] compute 
  - [ ] prefix-sum
